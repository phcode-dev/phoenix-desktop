3. LICENSE STRUCTURE AND EDITIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Unified Application License

The Installer and distributed application binary are licensed under
this Agreement.

This Agreement governs use of:

- Phoenix Code as distributed by the Company
- Both Community Edition and Pro Edition functionality contained within
  the same application

Feature availability depends on your plan/entitlements.

3.2 Community Edition and Open-Source Components

Certain components may be made available under open-source licenses
(including the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)) when the
Company separately distributes specific source code under those
licenses.

Open-source components are governed solely by the applicable open-source
license.

This Agreement does not replace or override applicable open-source
licenses for source code expressly released under them.

The compiled binaries and Installer provided by the Company are not
distributed under AGPL.

3.3 Pro Edition (Commercial)

Pro Edition features are proprietary and licensed under this Agreement
only.

- Pro Edition is not open source
- Open-source licenses do not apply to Pro Edition features unless
  explicitly stated

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. PRO ACCESS, TRIALS, LIFETIME PLANS, AND DOWNGRADES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Pro Access

Access to Pro Edition features requires an active Phoenix Pro Plan or
other entitlement.

The scope, duration, eligibility, and limits of Pro access are
determined by the Company and described at purchase, in-app, or in
Documentation.

4.2 Automatic Downgrade

If your Phoenix Pro Plan expires, is cancelled, or otherwise ends, the
Product automatically reverts to Community Edition functionality. No
additional notice is required.

4.3 No Data Deletion

Downgrading does not delete Your Content. Some Pro features and related
data formats/outputs may become unavailable or restricted.

4.4 Lifetime Plan Terms

A Lifetime Plan grants long-term access to eligible Pro Edition features
that run entirely on your device, subject to this Agreement and your
compliance with it.

Lifetime does not mean we must provide updates, support, or Online
Services forever.

1. Perpetual use of eligible on-device features:
   You may continue using the last Pro-enabled version you are entitled
   to indefinitely for eligible on-device Pro features.

2. Updates and service-backed features limited by Lifetime Update Period:
   Your entitlement to updates, upgrades, support, and any Pro features
   that rely on Online Services may be limited to the Lifetime Update
   Period stated at purchase.

3. Online Services may change:
   Online Services (including hosted libraries, cloud features,
   licensing, AI, or other service-backed features) may be modified,
   limited, or discontinued as described in Section 6.

4. Feature classification reference:
   The Company may publish which Pro features are on-device vs
   service-backed in the Phoenix Pro feature set/Documentation.

4.5 Activation, License Checks, and Internet Requirements

Some Pro features (including trial, subscription, and Lifetime Plan
entitlements) may require:

- Sign-in to your account (if applicable)
- Periodic license verification
- Internet access for activation, verification, or Online Services

If verification cannot be completed for a period of time, Pro features
may be temporarily unavailable until verification succeeds. Community
Edition features may remain available.

4.6 Pro Activation and Credential Sharing

Pro Edition access is granted through a Phoenix Pro Plan entitlement
(for example via account sign-in, license key, or other activation
method described in the applicable plan terms). Unless your plan terms
expressly allow otherwise, Pro entitlements are personal to the
purchaser/authorized user, and you may not share or make Pro access
available to others (including by sharing credentials, keys, tokens, or
activated copies).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. LICENSE GRANT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, the Company grants you a
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install
and use the Product for your internal personal or business purposes.

Unless the Company’s plan terms specify otherwise:

- You may install and use the Product on devices you own or control.
- You may copy and redistribute the Installer and Community Edition
  freely. However, you may not share, sell, transfer, sublicense, rent,
  or lease any Phoenix Pro Plan access, activation method, license key,
  entitlement, or account credentials, except where your plan terms
  expressly allow it or where prohibited by law.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Company.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. UPDATES, ONLINE SERVICES, AND AVAILABILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Updates and Changes

The Company may provide updates, upgrades, patches, or feature changes.
Some updates may be required to maintain security, compatibility, or
continued operation.

We may add, modify, limit, or discontinue features at any time,
including Pro features and Online Services.

6.2 Online Services

Some features rely on Online Services operated by the Company or third
parties. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to operate
Online Services in a reliable manner, but Online Services may from time
to time be unavailable due to maintenance, upgrades, outages, security
issues, capacity limits, third-party service failures, or events beyond
our reasonable control.

We may add, modify, limit, or discontinue Online Services (including
related features), and may change eligibility, limits, or access
requirements.

For paid Phoenix Pro Plans, if we elect to discontinue an Online Service
(or a paid feature that materially depends on that Online Service), we
will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least thirty (30)
days’ advance notice where reasonably practicable. We may discontinue or
suspend Online Services immediately (or with shorter notice) if required
by law, to address security, fraud, or abuse, or to prevent material
harm to the Company, users, or third parties.

If an Online Service is discontinued, you may still be able to use
Product features that do not depend on that Online Service. Mandatory
consumer rights remain unaffected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. RESTRICTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You may not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble Pro Edition features,
  except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law
- Circumvent, disable, or interfere with licensing, payments, feature
  controls, usage limits, or security mechanisms
- Provide access to Pro Edition features to third parties as a hosted
  service, time-share, service bureau, or similar arrangement unless
  expressly authorized
- Use the Product to develop or offer a product or service that
  substantially replicates Phoenix Code’s Pro Edition core functionality
- Remove or alter proprietary notices, trademarks, or license notices
  included in the Product

----------------------------------------------------------------------
8. YOUR CONTENT AND OWNERSHIP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1 You Own Your Content

You retain ownership of Your Content. The Company does not claim
ownership of your code, files, or projects.

8.2 Access to Your Content

To provide Product features (including sync, collaboration, AI Features,
or Online Services), the Product may process or transmit Your Content as
needed to perform the requested function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
9. PRIVACY, HEALTH REPORTS, AND AI DATA USE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

9.1 Privacy Policy

Our privacy practices are described in the Company’s Privacy Policy:
https://phcode.io/privacy

9.2 Health Reports (Anonymous Usage Statistics and Error Reports)

Phoenix Code provides optional Health Reports that collect anonymous
usage statistics and error/diagnostic reports to help us prioritize
features, find bugs, and improve usability and stability.

1. No personally identifiable information in Health Reports:
   Health Reports are designed so that the Company does not collect or
   process personally identifiable information through Health Reports.

2. Install ID (random):
   Health Reports may include a randomly generated Install ID created on
   installation to measure anonymous counts and trends over time. The
   Install ID is not derived from device hardware identifiers and is not
   intended to identify you. We do not use the Install ID to directly
   identify you, and it is not your account identifier.

3. Preview and control:
   You can view what would be sent and enable/disable Health Reports in
   the Product (for example, Help > Health Report).

4. Necessary anonymous health indicators:
   Certain anonymous measurements may be collected as necessary app
   health indicators, such as:
   - security/app update status checks,
   - analytics library initialization,
   - anonymous user counts, and
   - anonymous usage time, which are aggregate statistics and do not
     include personal data.

5. Support submissions:
   If you choose to send support materials, logs, screenshots, or files,
   those materials may include content you provide voluntarily and will
   be used to assist you and improve the Product.

9.3 No AI Training

By default, the Company does not use Your Content (including code,
files, or prompts) to train AI models, unless you explicitly opt in or
otherwise grant permission in a manner that clearly indicates your
intent.

9.4 AI Feature Processing

If you use AI Features:

- Your input (which may include Your Content) may be processed to
  generate output.
- AI outputs may be similar or identical for other users.
- You are responsible for reviewing and verifying AI output before
  relying on it.
- The Company does not claim ownership of AI-generated output produced
  for you.

If AI Features involve Third-Party Software or third-party AI services,
those providers may process data under their own terms, and details may
be described in the Privacy Policy or Documentation.

9.5 Account and Subscription Data (Separate from Health Reports)

If you create an account or purchase a Phoenix Pro Plan, the Company may
process account and subscription information (such as email address and
plan status) to provide authentication, billing, entitlement management,
fraud prevention, and customer support. This processing is governed by
the Privacy Policy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10. THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Product may include or depend on third-party software components,
libraries, and services ("Third-Party Software") that are governed by
their own licenses or terms. Your use of Third-Party Software is subject
to those third-party licenses and terms.

Third-Party Software license notices and attributions are provided with
the Product and/or made available at:

- In the source repository:
  https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/tree/main/src/thirdparty/licences
- Within the installed Product distribution (for example, in a
  "Third-Party Licenses" or similar notices location, where provided)

If there is a conflict between this Agreement and a Third-Party Software
license regarding that Third-Party Software, the Third-Party Software
license will control for that component. Third-Party Software is
provided by its respective owners, and the Company does not make any
warranties on behalf of third-party licensors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Product and Online Services
are provided "as is" and "as available."

The Company disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or
statutory, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the Product will meet your requirements, operate
without interruption, be secure, or be error-free, or that defects will
be corrected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

1. The Company is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
   consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenue,
   data, goodwill, or business interruption, arising out of or related
   to the Product or this Agreement.

2. The Company’s total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to
   this Agreement will not exceed:
   - for subscription plans: the amount you paid to the Company for the
     Product in the 12 months immediately before the event giving rise
     to the claim, and
   - for Lifetime Plans: the one-time amount paid for the Lifetime Plan,
   - and for free users: no liability (except to the extent liability
     cannot be excluded under applicable law),
   in each case whichever is applicable.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the
above may not apply to you. Mandatory consumer protection laws remain
unaffected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. TERM, TERMINATION, AND SURVIVAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

13.1 Term

This Agreement applies while you use the Product.

13.2 Termination

Agreement, if required for legal compliance, or if the Product is

13.3 Effect of Termination

Upon termination, you must stop using the Product. However, if you
purchased a Lifetime Plan and we terminate solely due to Product
discontinuation (not your breach), you may retain the right to use the
last entitled version for eligible on-device features, subject to
applicable law.

13.4 Survival

Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive,
including Sections on ownership, privacy/AI data use (as applicable),
disclaimers, limitation of liability, governing law, and dispute
provisions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
14. EXPORT AND SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
