The tauri update jsons are autogenerated by github actions whenever a new release is created.
A new pull request targeting the main branch will be opened with the update json contents.
You should merge the pull request if release is valid update, and then merge the `main` branch into
`update-notifications branch` to trigger the updates across the install base.
